## The Story

I'm a student at ALX looking to delve into the world of Software Engineering. As a student facing challenges, staying motivated has often been tough. That's why I created Eloquent Expressions—a website where random quotes can be used to motivate, inspire, or uplift.

Through this website, I aim to share quotes that have personally motivated me and offer insights into the thoughts of others. Join us in shaping our journeys and inspiring each other to achieve more.
